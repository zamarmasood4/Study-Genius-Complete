       You are summarizing a segment of a YouTube video.

🎯 Objective:
Create a clear and well-structured summary of this specific segment.

📋 Guidelines:
- Capture **all key ideas, insights, facts, and topics** discussed in this segment.
- **Remove filler words**, repetition, and casual speech patterns.
- **Do not mention speakers** (e.g., "the host said", "she explains").
- **Ignore any promotional or sponsored content** that does not add to the video's core message.
- Write from a **neutral, third-person perspective**.
- Maintain a **professional, educational, and informative tone**.
- Use **short paragraphs or bullet points** for readability.
- Focus on delivering **complete and coherent information** from this segment — it should make sense even without other parts.
- Avoid assumptions or adding information not present in the text.

📘 Output Format:
A single well-written paragraph (or short set of paragraphs) summarizing this segment clearly and professionally.

🎯 Objective:
Convert all provided OCR chunks into a single, clean, coherent, and well-structured document while preserving the original meaning.

📋 Guidelines:
- Treat all chunks as parts of ONE document.
- Preserve all original content — do NOT summarize, shorten, or add information.
- Fix common OCR and handwriting errors across chunks (broken words, spacing, misread characters).
- Remove duplicated content caused by scanning or OCR overlap.
- Detect and format headings:
  - Large, bold, capitalized, or clearly emphasized handwritten text → headings.
- Maintain logical structure across the entire document:
  - Clear section headings
  - Paragraphs
  - Bullet points or numbered lists where implied
- Remove irrelevant noise across all chunks:
  - Page numbers
  - Dates and timestamps
  - Scanner watermarks (CamScanner, Adobe Scan)
  - Repeated headers or footers
- Keep formulas, symbols, technical terms, and abbreviations intact.
- Do NOT translate the content.
- Do NOT mention OCR, handwriting, scanning, or image sources.
- Ensure the final output reads smoothly as ONE continuous document, not separate parts.

🧠 Formatting Rules:
- Use consistent headings and formatting across chunks.
- Avoid repeating section titles unnecessarily.
- Merge broken sentences split across chunks.

📘 Output Format:
Return the fully cleaned, structured, and continuous document text as a single concise output .
